# Laravel as Api + React
This repository contains simple software developed using the Laravel framework to create a RESTful API and the React framework with MaterialUI to build the user interface. Was done to explore the integration of both with separated folders. Futhermore, this app have additional resources, like authentication with Sanctum token and a real time chat made with Pusher.

For VueJS, Angular or any other framework of javascript the general implementation will be exactly the same: an frontend folder, with the layout for the client, and the backend with Laravel that is prepared, for default, to deal with CORS (cross origin domain) and have packages to generate auth tokens, like sanctum.
